## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siddhantj007/NYPD_Hate_Crimes_ML_Project.git

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. How to Use:
- Open the Jupyter Notebook
- Run the cells sequentially.

Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
Model evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results
- Best model: XGBoost
- Recommendations: Improve with more diverse data and better feature engineering.

**macOS note:** XGBoost wheels require libomp.
Install once via Homebrew: `brew install libomp`.
